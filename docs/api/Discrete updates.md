# Discrete updates

JPC provides access to standard discrete optimisers to update the parameters of 
PC networks ([jpc.update_pc_params](https://thebuckleylab.github.io/jpc/api/Discrete%20updates/#jpc.update_pc_params)),
and to both discrete ([jpc.update_pc_activities](https://thebuckleylab.github.io/jpc/api/Discrete%20updates/#jpc.update_pc_activities)) 
and continuous optimisers ([jpc.solve_inference](https://thebuckleylab.github.io/jpc/api/Continuous-time%20Inference/#jpc.solve_inference)) 
to solve the PC inference or activity dynamics.
