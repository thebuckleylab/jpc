    "This notebook is a walk-through of how Predictive Coding (PC) is implemented in JPC. It was developed as a lab session of an MSc course at the University of Sussex. We are going to implement all the core functionalities of JPC from scratch, building towards the training of a simple feedforward network to classify MNIST.\n",

    "If you're not familiar with JAX, have a look at their [docs](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/quickstart.html), but we will explain all the necessary concepts below. JAX is basically numpy for GPUs and other hardware accelerators. We will also use: (i) [Equinox](https://docs.kidger.site/equinox/), which allows you to define neural nets with PyTorch-like syntax; and (ii) [Optax](https://optax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html), which provides a range of common machine learning optimisers such as gradient descent and Adam."
